<center> <h2> The Coderman </h2> </center>
<center> <p> Ahmed Elsaeyed, known to many as Buckets, is an aspiring software engineer, but is generally curious about anything done on the computer. Like most people who spend the majority of their time in front of a screen, he is no stranger to sleepless nights (people who stay up late are more creative). Coding takes up most of his time, be it for class or just for fun, but he also does graphic design on the side. Ahmed believes in the middle path between functionality and aesthetics- you can't sacrifice one for the other. As such, he aspires for the code he writes to be as readable and pleasing to the eye as the programs or websites it produces. Ahmed does his best GD work on Photoshop, which he learned initially in order to make the highest quality memes. Howevr, since then he has moved on to making flyers, logos, and graphics for the web. He is slowly making the transition to video editing, animation, and VFX, which he thinks are the coolest things ever. They add a whole new dimension to the already expanding world of memes.
